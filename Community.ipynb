As an analogy in geography, think of each community as a city and the nodes as streets. We allow nodes in different communities to have same names just as we reuse the same street names in different cities. Then a random walk can be described by enumerating all the city names and street names visited by the random walk. For example, to go to my favorite restaurant, I would take the following path: \n",

You would want popular streets (nodes) to have shorter names and reuse those names as much as possible. It might seem beneficial to have many communities so that you can reuse the street (node) names to a large extent, but then the city names will appear frequently in a typical path and that might increase the description length.
