And then the (valued) interactions between the individuals and the products - e.g., ratings, likes and dislikes, and purchases - are determined by the distances between the individuals and the products in the latent space. However, the latent factors and the positions are unknown and they are usually estimated by the matrix factorization method."

    "### Exponential Random Graph Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The expoential random graph model is for general link predictions, especially when nodes have attributes. It is a parametric model for the probability distribution of networks. It can be viewed as a generalization of the Logistic regression to predict edges: for every pair of nodes, the outcome is whether or not there is an edge between the two nodes and predictors are any attributes of the nodes. However, ERGM is more general and models the probability of the network as a whole instead of modelling every pair of nodes. Consequently, it even allows using any statistics of a network including global properties such as edge density and global transitivity. Most importantly, by modelling the probability of a whole network ERGM considers the correlation structure between pairs, which is overlooked in the Logistic regression model where the pairs are assumed to be independent.

However, most of the time we only observe one or two snapshots of the network under study; how can we estimate this model with only one data point? This issue is addressed by advanced MCMC techniques, but the estimation process is quite complicated and is hence beyond the scope of this course. The rough idea behind it is similar to the maximal likelihood estimation for logistic regressions. Finally, the estimates of the coefficients and their statistical significance tell us how much each statistic in the vector $x(a)$ contributes to the formation of edges and the network. "
